Ergonomic Risk Assessment in Manual Handling Tasks Using ML-OMC
Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) are prevalent, often resulting from awkward postures and heavy lifting. This study aims to validate the accuracy and reliability of markerless optical motion capture (ML-OMC) systems for ergonomic risk assessment by comparing them with marker-based optical motion capture (MB-OMC) and inertial measurement units (IMUs) during a lifting task.

Methodology:
Eight participants performed a lifting task while their joint angles were recorded using three measurement systems: ML-OMC, MB-OMC, and IMUs. Joint reaction forces were estimated using joint angle data and ground reaction forces through biomechanical modeling. Postural ergonomic assessment scores were calculated for the lifting initiation posture using the three systems and inputs from biomechanics experts.

Inputs:
- Number of participants: 8 (4 males, 4 females; age: 25 ± 3 years, height: 166 ± 7 cm, body mass: 61 ± 7 kg)

Measurement Systems:
- ML-OMC: Vision-based markerless optical motion capture
- MB-OMC: Vicon, Oxford Metric, UK | Sampling Frequency: 100 Hz
- IMUs: MTws, Xsens Technologies, NL | Sampling Frequency: 40 Hz
- Force Plate: AMTI OR6-7-OP, USA | Sampling Frequency: 1200 Hz

Task: Lifting a 28 lbs. (12.7 kg) box from the floor to pelvis height while standing with each foot on a force plate.

- Joint Angles Recorded: Back, neck, knee, elbow, shoulder

Biomechanical Modeling: Joint reaction forces estimated using joint angle data and ground reaction forces.

Data preprocessing included downsampling the recorded data to a uniform frequency of 40 Hz for analysis. The ML-OMC data were aligned with synchronized MB-OMC, IMUs, and force plate data using the peak of the hip joint angle as a reference point.
